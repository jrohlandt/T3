Bug list
---------

1. If you click start and almost immediately thereafter you press stop. The activeTask will be updated but the activeTask state will not update and you will
be unable to create or start a new task.

2. if you select a project on a blank task and hit start and, then you reload the page, the start button will still say "start" instead of "stop".
